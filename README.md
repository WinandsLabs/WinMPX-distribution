### 🛡️ Security & Windows SmartScreen
As independent developers, we distribute this software directly to our users. Because this specific version has not yet built up a "reputation" history with Microsoft's automated systems, Windows SmartScreen may display an "Unrecognized App" warning.

**To complete the installation:**
1. Click **"More Info"** (Más información) on the warning dialog.
2. Click **"Run anyway"** (Ejecutar de todas formas).

**Our Commitment to Safety:**
We take security seriously. Every release is scanned and verified. You may verify the installer yourself by uploading it to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) to check against 70+ industry-standard antivirus engines.
